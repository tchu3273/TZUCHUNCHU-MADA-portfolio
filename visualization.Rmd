For Module 5 exercise, I am going to re-create a graph published on **FiveThirtyEight**. The original graph can be found in the article titled ["The Media Really Has Neglected Puerto Rico"](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-media-really-has-neglected-puerto-rico/). Data were captured from Media Cloud, which includes number of sentences that mentioned the names of hurricane Harvey, Irma, Maria or Jose on each day from 8/20/2017 to 9/9/2017, and TV news that covered state of Texas, Florida or Puerto Rico were also collected in the same fashion. I also created an animated GIF to show you how the graph was re-created from start to finish!

## Load packages
```{r, warning = F, message = F}
# load R packages
library(tidyverse) # tidyverse offers great tools for data wrangling and visualization
library(ggpubr) # used to arrange multiple ggplots 
```

## Load raw data
```{r}
# path to data
hurricanes_data_location <- here::here("Module-5-Visualization","data","puerto-rico-media","mediacloud_hurricanes.csv")
states_data_location     <- here::here("Module-5-Visualization","data","puerto-rico-media","mediacloud_states.csv")

# load data. 
hurricanes_data <- read.csv(hurricanes_data_location)
states_data     <- read.csv(states_data_location)
```

Check the data structure and summary of both hurricanes and states data
```{r}
# look up data structure
str(hurricanes_data)
str(states_data)
```

```{r}
# get the data summary
summary(hurricanes_data)
summary(states_data)
```

## Data wrangling
I noticed that R loaded the data and recognized the date variable in both data as character, now I will convert them to date variables to proceed with further plotting.

```{r}
# use as.Date() to convert date from character to date format
hurricanes_data_proccessed <- 
  hurricanes_data %>% 
  mutate(Date = as.Date(Date, format = "%m/%d/%y"))
  
states_data_proccessed <- 
  states_data %>% 
  mutate(Date = as.Date(Date, format = "%m/%d/%y")) %>% 
  #r ename column
  rename("Puerto.Rico" = "X.Puerto.Rico.")

# check data summary again
summary(hurricanes_data)
summary(states_data)
```

Then, I transformed the data format from wide to long using pivot_longer() in tidyr package. Number of columns will be reduced to three, which include Date, Hurricane/State and sentence per day. 

```{r}
# pivot data from wide to long
hurricanes_data_long <- 
  hurricanes_data_proccessed %>% 
  # Hurricane Jose was removed from the graph, so I will do the same
  select(Date, Harvey, Irma, Maria) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = Harvey:Maria,
    names_to = "Hurricane",
    values_to = "Sent_per_d")

states_data_long <- 
  states_data_proccessed %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = Texas:Florida,
    names_to = "States",
    values_to = "Sent_per_d")

# Check if data were re-structured successfully
View(hurricanes_data_long)
View(states_data_long)
```

## Begin plotting

### First attempt
First, I used geom_area() from ggplot2 package to plot area chart in default setting.

```{r, warning = F}
p1 <- ggplot(hurricanes_data_long, aes(x = Date, y = Sent_per_d, fill = Hurricane)) +
  geom_area()

p2 <- ggplot(states_data_long, aes(x = Date, y = Sent_per_d, fill = States)) +
  geom_area()

# combine plots together
plot.1 <- ggarrange(p1, p2, nrow = 1)

#save figure
figure_file = here::here("Module-5-Visualization","results","plot.1.png")
ggsave(filename = figure_file, plot=plot.1, width = 10, height = 5, dpi = 300) 
```


![](Module-5-Visualization/results/plot.1.png)

The stacked area chart was created by default, which looks different from the original graph. I need to create a dodged area chart instead, and to do so I will set the position = "dodge". 

### Create a dodged area chart
```{r, warning = F}
p1 <- ggplot(hurricanes_data_long, aes(x = Date, y = Sent_per_d, fill = Hurricane)) +
  geom_area(position = "dodge")

p2 <- ggplot(states_data_long, aes(x = Date, y = Sent_per_d, fill = States)) +
  geom_area(position = "dodge")

# combine plots together
plot.2 <- ggarrange(p1, p2, nrow = 1)

#save figure
figure_file = here::here("Module-5-Visualization","results","plot.2.png")
ggsave(filename = figure_file, plot=plot.2, width = 10, height = 5, dpi = 300) 
```


![](Module-5-Visualization/results/plot.2.png)

## Customize plot appearance
Next, I will make a couple of adjustments to match the appearance of the graph with the published one The following changes will be made:
* Change the order of states variable 
* remove legends
* Change plot theme
* change scales of x-axis and y-axis
* Remove x-axis label
* change the y-axis label

At first, I struggled a bit with the date breaks and labels on the x-axis. I tried to use date_breaks ="1 week" to label the date starting from 08/20/2017 to 09/22/2017 but the plot only only began on 08/21/2017. I think the reason is because there was no data at all on that day. I ended up adding each break and label manually. For more information about position scales for date/time data, you can look up [ggplot2 website](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/scale_date.html). 

```{r, warning = F}
p1 <- ggplot(hurricanes_data_long, aes(x = Date, y = Sent_per_d, fill = Hurricane)) +
  geom_area(position = "dodge") +
  # change x-axis range to reflect the dates shown in the original plot
  scale_x_date(breaks = as.Date(c("2017-08-20","2017-08-27","2017-09-03","2017-09-10","2017-09-17")),
               labels = c("AUG.20.2017","AUG.27","SEPT.3","SEPT.10","SEPT.17"),
               limits = as.Date(c("2017-08-19","2017-09-22"))) + 
  # change y-axis scale
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0,4000,1000),
                     labels = c("0","1,000","2,000","3,000","4,000"),
                     limits = c(0, 4500)) +
  # change to cleaner background 
  theme_bw() +
  # remove lengend
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  # remove x-axis label
  xlab("") +
  # change y-axis label
  ylab("Sentence per day")
  
# give a specific order for states
states_data_long$States <- factor(states_data_long$States , levels=c("Texas","Florida","Puerto.Rico") )
p2 <- ggplot(states_data_long, aes(x = Date, y = Sent_per_d, fill = States)) +
  geom_area(position = "dodge") +
  # change x-axis range to reflect the dates shown in the original plot
  scale_x_date(breaks = as.Date(c("2017-08-20","2017-08-27","2017-09-03","2017-09-10","2017-09-17")),
               labels = c("AUG.20.2017","AUG.27","SEPT.3","SEPT.10","SEPT.17"),
               limits = as.Date(c("2017-08-19","2017-09-22"))) + 
  # change y-axis scale
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0,4000,1000),
                     labels = c("0","1,000","2,000","3,000","4,000"),
                     limits = c(0, 5100)) +
  # change to cleaner background 
  theme_bw() +
  # remove legend
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  # remove x-axis label
  xlab("") +
  # change y-axis label
  ylab("Sentence per day")


# combine plots together
plot.3 <- ggarrange(p1, p2, nrow = 1)

#save figure
figure_file = here::here("Module-5-Visualization","results","plot.3.png")
ggsave(filename = figure_file, plot=plot.3, width = 10, height = 5, dpi = 300) 

```

### Change the color and grid lines of the plot 
I then changed the color of the area by using scale_fill_manual(). I found a website that generates a HTML color code, so you can pick the color you want to customize the plot easily. Here is the [link](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/) to the website. Furthermore, I just want the grid lines on each axis with shown values, and I achieved it by following the instructions on this [website](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/theme.html).     

```{r, warning = F}
p1 <- ggplot(hurricanes_data_long, aes(x = Date, y = Sent_per_d, fill = Hurricane)) +
  geom_area(position = "dodge") +
  # change x-axis range to reflect the dates shown in the original plot
  scale_x_date(breaks = as.Date(c("2017-08-20","2017-08-27","2017-09-03","2017-09-10","2017-09-17")),
               labels = c("AUG.20.2017","AUG.27","SEPT.3","SEPT.10","SEPT.17"),
               limits = as.Date(c("2017-08-19","2017-09-22"))) + 
  # change y-axis scale
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0,4000,1000),
                     labels = c("0","1,000","2,000","3,000","4,000"),
                     limits = c(0, 4500)) +
  # change plot color
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#E66D0F","#E34C82","#52CBC6")) +
  # remove legend
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        # change panel background 
        panel.background = element_blank(),
        panel.border = element_rect(fill = NA),
        text = element_text(size = 10),
        # only add grid lines on axis with labeled values and choose lighter grey color
        panel.grid.major.x = element_line(color = "grey90"),
        panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color = "grey90")) +
  # remove x-axis label
  xlab("") +
  # change and bold y-axis label
  ylab(expression(bold("Sentences per day")))
  
# give a specific order for states
states_data_long$States <- factor(states_data_long$States , levels=c("Texas","Florida","Puerto.Rico") )
p2 <- ggplot(states_data_long, aes(x = Date, y = Sent_per_d, fill = States)) +
  geom_area(position = "dodge") +
  # change x-axis range to reflect the dates shown in the original plot
  scale_x_date(breaks = as.Date(c("2017-08-20","2017-08-27","2017-09-03","2017-09-10","2017-09-17")),
               labels = c("AUG.20.2017","AUG.27","SEPT.3","SEPT.10","SEPT.17"),
               limits = as.Date(c("2017-08-19","2017-09-22"))) + 
  # change y-axis scale
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0,4000,1000),
                     labels = c("0","1,000","2,000","3,000","4,000"),
                     limits = c(0, 5100)) +
  # change plot color
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#E66D0F","#E34C82","#52CBC6")) +
  # change to cleaner background 
  theme_bw() +

  theme(legend.position = "none",
        # change panel background 
        panel.background = element_blank(),
        panel.border = element_rect(fill = NA),
        text = element_text(size = 10),
        # only add grid lines on axis with labeled values and choose lighter grey color
        panel.grid.major.x = element_line(color = "grey90"),
        panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color = "grey90")) +
  # remove x-axis label
  xlab("") +
  # remove y-axis label
  ylab("")


# combine plots together
plot.4 <- ggarrange(p1, p2, nrow = 1)

#save figure

## The final look of the replicated plot

![](Module-5-Visualization/results/plot.4.png)

I think the plot looks very close to the original plot. For some reasons, the states data I downloaded did not match exactly what were presented in the original article. The numbers were a bit off, for instance, the maximum sentences per day in Texas is 5,072, but it looks like it was not higher than 4,500 in the original plot. Another issue that I couldn't resolve is to center the subtitle. I first used plotmath expression to construct the main title and subtitle, and then used annotate_figure to add the texts to the plot, but it defaulted to left alignment, and I couldn't figure out how to alter that. OVerall, this was a fun exercise even though I probably spent too much time figuring out all the little details and tried to make it perfect.
